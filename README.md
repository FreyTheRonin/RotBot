# RotBot

A bot which does various rot13 related stuff that's very useful for mobile users and stuff.

To use this bot on your own server, create a bot app and get a token for it, which you can paste onto the script's token variable. Then run the script.

### Version 1.0.2
* Now says "Fuck you, Eurasia." instead of "Fuck you Eurasia".
* Bot's token is now stored in a variable before all methods are defined instead of directly inputted in the run() arguments.
* Changed the limit of messages .rl checks from 15 to 100.
* Direct Message behavior has been altered; now rots any text the user DMs the bot, except for .rhelp, which works normally.
* .rhelp command now uses rich embed and is declared before all methods are defined.
* Updated .rhelp command to reflect changes. Also hid information about the .rot command, since it's now superfluous.
